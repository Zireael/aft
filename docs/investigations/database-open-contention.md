# Deferred database open under cross-process contention

## What changed

`b1e87c9d9` moved `configure_database_runtime` from configure's synchronous prefix to the post-ack `DatabaseRuntime` maintenance stage. It also changed failed initialization from a warning and cleared pools (the old "running with JSON-only persistence" path) into a failed readiness state that refuses tools. `3c9f37c46` narrowed that gate to persistence-dependent tools and added a ten-second off-executor wait. Neither change added a SQLite-open retry.

Before these changes, `App::open_db` held a **process-local** database-slot mutex, then `db::open` created a connection, applied PRAGMAs, and ran migrations. The existing busy timeout was five seconds, installed before `journal_mode=WAL`. Migration steps used `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and re-read the schema version after taking the write lock. There was no cross-process file lock or application retry loop. Moving the open did not remove such protection; making every open error permanent exposed transient contention as a latched readiness failure. The old path was not proof that every concurrent open succeeded.

## SQLite failure boundary

Connection creation precedes `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`. Switching a rollback-journal database to WAL requires locks on the database; another process can prevent that transition. SQLite can return BUSY from journal-mode transitions without invoking the busy handler (notably lock-upgrade/deadlock avoidance). A busy timeout is consequently not an application retry policy. Even when the handler is invoked, a lock held beyond five seconds exhausts the old timeout.

With the retry loop disabled and the old five-second handler restored, the original two-process concurrent test failed on repetition 7 of a 30-run loop. The added step attribution reported **`sqlite PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL: database is locked`**. The whole failing repetition finished in 2.28 seconds, including process startup/shutdown, so the five-second handler did not cover this failure. This pins the reproduced concurrent-open failure to WAL setup, not connection creation or `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.

The original unqualified `sqlite error: database is locked` response did not identify the statement: it excluded the separately formatted `MigrationFailed` path but could not distinguish PRAGMAs from initial schema setup. PRAGMA failures now preserve their exact step in `OpenError`. Deterministic regressions hold an exclusive rollback-journal lock through SQLite, exercising the WAL transition rather than assuming that connection creation takes the lock.

## Recovery policy

Deferred initial opening retries only SQLite BUSY and LOCKED primary codes (including extended codes and migration wrappers). It reuses the owning connection, with exponential sleep from 10 to 200 ms and a ten-second retry budget. Each initialization busy-handler wait is capped at 100 ms and remaining budget; a successful connection regains its ordinary five-second busy timeout. Completed migration steps remain committed; failed transactions roll back before another attempt. Non-transient errors are returned immediately.

Readiness distinguishes permanent failure from busy exhaustion. Exhaustion is reported once as `database_unavailable` with `retryable: true`, without performing the requested operation. A subsequent persistence call claims one new attempt. Per-call retries use **one open attempt**, with the named `TOOL_RETRY_BUSY_WAIT` of 250 ms and no application backoff loop. Standalone direct and `tool_call` dispatch remain synchronous for this short attempt; a contended attempt returns the same retryable refusal. The deferred initial open alone retains the ten-second contention retry budget. Subc schedules its per-call retry as a `MaintenanceCommit` job so read-only calls remain available and config-changing binds cannot race pool installation. Its generation check prevents an old queued retry from overwriting a newer bind. Subc callers use the existing deadline-bounded wait outside executor admission. No raw database, WAL, or SHM descriptors are opened for locking or probing.

The first implementation also gave each subc retry job the full ten-second budget, occupying a `MaintenanceCommit` worker throughout contention. That is unnecessary worker occupancy for a user-requested retry: subc now uses the same single attempt and 250 ms busy wait as standalone. This bounds each SQLite busy-handler wait, not arbitrary filesystem latency or successful schema migration work. Both modes still serialize on the process-shared database-slot mutex, so a retry can wait behind another root's initial open; that startup-only serialization is retained to preserve one owning connection. The initial deferred opening can still occupy its maintenance worker for the ten-second contention budget; that one-time startup work is retained to tolerate concurrent process startup.

If a retry has no configured canonical root, it logs the missing-root error and publishes a non-retryable `database_unavailable` refusal instead of panicking. Read-only calls remain available.

## Verification

The integration regressions release an exclusive lock after six seconds (past the old five-second handler, within the new budget), and hold it through exhaustion before releasing it and retrying without rebind. The wire-admission regression also exercises exhaustion and the next call's maintenance retry. Existing non-transient failure/rebind and deferred readiness tests retain their contracts. A standalone regression pipelines a persistence retry and a real file read while the exclusive lock remains held, requiring both responses within two seconds. Restoring the ten-second per-call mode makes that regression fail. A unit regression verifies that a missing configured root yields the named non-retryable refusal without a panic.

The macOS repetition gate passed **100/100 runs** again after adding the short per-call mode and missing-root guard. The state-command suite (16 tests), `database_` suite (16 tests), and full `db::` suite (59 tests) also passed. It uses the existing two-process test, without test-level retries or accepting refusal responses:

```sh
for i in $(seq 1 100); do
  echo "concurrent run $i/100"
  CARGO_BUILD_RUSTC_WRAPPER= RUSTC_WRAPPER= cargo test -q \
    -p agent-file-tools --test integration \
    state_commands_test::db_set_host_state_concurrent_insert -- --exact || exit $?
done
```

Negative controls restore the old single-attempt initialization with a five-second busy handler, and separately force busy exhaustion into the permanent-failure readiness state. The first makes `deferred_database_open_retries_journal_lock_until_release` fail with the WAL lock error; the second makes `deferred_database_open_busy_exhaustion_retries_without_rebind` fail on `retryable: false`. Both controls are restored before verification of the delivered implementation.
