# Prose search with checkout views

## Reproduction and limits

The investigation used an isolated scratch Git repository, private storage and
a loopback embedding backend, through the real configure and search entry points.
No live SQLite file was opened, and no daemon was stopped or reconfigured.

`per_checkout_semantic_runtime::prose_watchdog_query_reports_views_coverage_and_keeps_symbol_previews`
uses the query:

> how does the bash watchdog kill a background task that exceeded its timeout

The filled checkout serves **11 vectors**. The semantic lane returns **11 raw
hits**, with **0 pending files**, **0 failed files** and complete coverage. Its
public answer has five distinct files. Before the fix, the first result was:

```text
src/watchdog.rs [lexical match]
```

After the fix, the same first result is:

```text
src/watchdog.rs [lexical match]
  kill_expired_task [function] lines 3-5
      pub fn kill_expired_task() {
          terminate_child();
      }
```

This proves that missing semantic-looking rows do **not** establish an empty
view or a failed query embedding. A semantic contribution can supply the symbol
while lexical wins the file's fused provenance. It does not establish the live
daemon's vector count: that count remains unmeasured. The provided `view loaded`
log alone cannot establish that every file has vectors. This investigation chose
the scratch-reproduction option rather than copying the live store.

## Why the symbol disappeared

`commands/semantic_search/mod.rs:4377-4410` retains the semantic lane's best
symbol metadata per file. At `:4870-4924`, the fused file can keep that metadata
but get `source = "lexical"` when lexical is its winning non-exact lane.

Previously, `snippet_set_by_engine` (`:3804`) treated every lexical result as
an already-selected matching line. That is true for lexical-only file summaries,
but false for semantic symbols with lexical-winning provenance. Source preview
enrichment therefore skipped them. The rendering loop (`:7780`) also treated
every lexical result as a file-only match and skipped its symbol header/body.
Together these branches reduced a populated semantic symbol to a bare file path.

The fix restricts both shortcuts to `FileSummary`. Real symbols keep fresh,
rank-budgeted source previews and their line ranges. The file still says
`[lexical match]`: its winning lane is not relabelled as semantic.

Git history locates these broad shortcuts in `fbd264f22` (identifier answer
rendering), before both reported cards, `8905b87d7` and `6aa715d2f`. The changes
between those two cards do not introduce either shortcut. The different display
can depend on whether the file has semantic symbol metadata at query time:
lexical-only file summaries use the matching-line route and already had snippets.
No code-only bisect between the two cards can isolate that state-dependent bug.

## The legacy import conflict

Semantic family keys address **inputs**: file bytes, relative path, chunker,
template/caps and model fingerprint (`views/semantic.rs:106-122`). They do not
hash the output vectors. `migration/per_checkout.rs:1316-1317` places legacy
vector bytes under that input key. Separate backend invocations can yield
different float bytes for the same inputs.

The family store correctly refuses a different payload under the same key
(`blob_store/v2.rs:459-511`). Previously `store_bundle` propagated that conflict
with `?`, aborting the entire import, including unrelated semantic files and
subsequent artifacts. The failure can leave a resumable ledger at `Validated`;
it is not evidence that the subsequent semantic view loaded no vectors. The
view worker loads independently and fills missing content.

The import rule now keeps and touches the first stored payload **only if it
decodes for the expected semantic producer** (`migration/per_checkout.rs:1754`).
The store's immutable equal-key/equal-payload rule is unchanged. Invalid or
quarantined semantic keys are skipped individually, logged by key, excluded
from the successful-file count and published as pending rather than ready
(`:1878`, `:1954`). Other files still import. I/O/database errors and trigram
conflicts are not suppressed. Durable staged bundles and legacy caches are not
rewritten; a resumed import applies the same rule again.

Two regressions cover these choices:

- `semantic_import_keeps_the_first_vector_payload_and_imports_other_keys`
  supplies different vector bytes under the same input key, verifies the
  existing payload is immutable and that every other key imports.
- `semantic_import_rejects_only_the_unusable_key` checks both an invalid
  existing payload and a quarantined key. Only that file remains pending, and
  the ledger completes.

## Honest coverage labels

A second scratch case loads a view but holds its fill. It serves **0 vectors**
and **0 semantic hits**, with `lib.rs` named as pending. The pre-fix reply
correctly included that gap but contradicted it with a final `semantic: ready`.

`SearchLaneStatus::attach_labels` (`commands/semantic_search/mod.rs:1786`)
appended runtime usability labels after the query had already disclosed its
coverage. Runtime readiness is not coverage completeness. It now honours the
reply's `semantic_gap` in the footer, rendering `semantic: partial (checkout
coverage gaps)` or the named unavailable reason. Query-only and split requests
also label the semantic response status from their actual checkout gaps, rather
than calling it ready. The regression
`unfilled_checkout_semantic_view_names_the_gap_without_a_ready_footer` checks
both request forms without timing or a running fill worker.

## The walk trailer: proposal only

`commands/semantic_search/trailer.rs:100-110` maps an exhausted candidate list
(`S2Exhausted`) to `Reason::Walk` whenever the requested page does not contain
the entire list. Thus `shown 8 of 76 results (walk)` can mean “all candidate
lanes exhausted, but only the requested page is shown”, not a filesystem walk.

An honest future wording would be **`shown 8 of 76 results (page)`**, with the
existing narrowing knobs. Exhaustion establishes the exact total; pagination
explains why only eight were printed. A distinct page reason would preserve
`walk` for actual bounded walks. No trailer, shared reason vocabulary or
trailer-contract fixture is changed here.

## Verification and ranking boundary

The only ranking-fenced production file touched is
`commands/semantic_search/mod.rs`. Enumeration, lane selection, scores, fusion,
candidate metadata, ordering and page cuts are unchanged. There is an
`engine_unwired` descriptor for the task branch.

The pinned replay completed **16 exact-recall fixtures**, **26 concept fixtures**
and **93 real-query rows** using `aft 0.58.2`. Exact recall is 1.000. All 93 rows
are byte-identical to the reference after removing only `summary_text` from each
row; the complete families, fixture groups, shapes and mechanisms are also
byte-identical. The score SHA-256 is
`35d02c69960cfeef0afcbb55a4c026534c55c40643b23869bf96a93822cc0613`.

The unmodified full `engine_unwired` predicate nevertheless returns
`engine_unwired_mismatch:row=real_query.followup-census:910001`: ten split rows
capture the first eight display lines in `summary_text`, and those lines encoded
the bare-path bug. Their previews intentionally change. The affected row suffixes
are `910001`, `910003`-`910009`, `910011`, and `910012`. No reference, manifest,
answer key or gate predicate was changed to conceal this presentation conflict.

The debug-binary full replay timed out at the shell's 30-minute cap after exact
and concept completed. The failed real-query phase was rerun successfully with
the optimized release binary; the already-completed phases were not rerun.
The fixture server logged broken pipes while shutting down its held-building
backend, but the 93-row replay exited 0 with its complete score artifact.

Affected gates pass: 101 search unit tests, 12 migration unit tests, six views
runtime integration tests, 12 public tool-call parity tests, 17 migration
integration tests (one child-only fixture ignored), 204 engine tests and 172
list-envelope tests. The Windows `--tests` compile with warnings denied and
`cargo fmt --all -- --check` pass. Scoped Rust diagnostics report zero errors
and warnings. Rust/cargo are 1.99.0, rustfmt 1.10.0, Python 3.9.6.

Every fix had a running pre-fix failing regression. Four staged-state mutation
proofs reverted its essential control in turn, marked `NON-VACUITY BREAK`,
captured a non-empty diff, ran the affected target, restored from the staged
implementation and captured an empty diff:

| Disabled control | Only test that failed | Other tests still passing |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Preview enrichment for lexical-winning symbols | `lexical_winner_with_semantic_symbol_keeps_its_location_and_preview` | 100 search tests, including the coverage-gap regression |
| Coverage-aware footer | `unfilled_checkout_semantic_view_names_the_gap_without_a_ready_footer` | 100 search tests, including the symbol-preview regression |
| First-valid-payload reuse | `semantic_import_keeps_the_first_vector_payload_and_imports_other_keys` | 11 migration tests, including unusable-key isolation |
| Per-key rejection rather than whole-import abort | `semantic_import_rejects_only_the_unusable_key` | 11 migration tests, including first-payload reuse |

The restored targets are green. Mutation markers are not part of the delivered
code. Full mutation logs and benchmark artifacts remain under the ignored
`benchmarks/aft-search/.bench/search-prose/` in the task worktree.
