# Worker guide: AFT

The commands to build, check and test this repository, the commands not to use, and how to tell that a check really ran. Use the exact commands here. Never substitute a bare package-runner name (`npx biome`, `npx tsc`): from a package folder it can fetch an unrelated npm package and "pass" without checking anything.

A check that prints nothing and exits 0 is not a pass unless this guide says that check is silent on success. Report the version line and the number of checks run.

## Rust (`crates/aft`, package `agent-file-tools`)

| Gate | Command | Proof it ran |
|---|---|---|
| Format | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | Silent on success. Show `cargo fmt --version` and exit 0. |
| Windows compile | `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings -A deprecated" cargo check -p agent-file-tools --tests --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` | `Finished` line. Compile-only: it cannot catch Windows runtime failures. |
| Unit (lib) | `cargo test -p agent-file-tools --lib -- <filter>` | `test result: ok. N passed` with N > 0. A filter that matches nothing reports `0 passed`, which is not a pass. |
| Binary tests | `cargo test -p agent-file-tools --bin aft -- <filter>` | Same as above. Shared infrastructure (locks, leases, capability gates, path identity) breaks fixtures here too. |
| Integration | `cargo test -p agent-file-tools --test integration -- <filter>` | Same as above. |
| Other test targets | `--test engine`, `--test list_envelope`, `--test rest`, `--test semantic`, `--test alert`, `--test watcher_integration` | Same as above. |
| Real rust-analyzer | prefix with `AFT_TEST_REQUIRE_RUST_ANALYZER=1` | Without it, real-server tests skip silently. |
| Full suite | `cargo test -p agent-file-tools`, or `scripts/rust-test-gate.sh` | The gate prints `GATE PASSED` / `GATE FAILED` as its last line. |

Mandatory when you touch them:
- A list-cutting site (`.take(`, `truncate(`, a cap): register it, then run `cargo test -p agent-file-tools --test list_envelope`.
- A new file under the search engine: register its owner, then run `cargo test -p agent-file-tools --test engine`.
- An agent tool argument: regenerate with `bun run --cwd packages/opencode-plugin build:tool-schemas`. The committed `crates/aft/src/subc_tool_schemas.json` must match byte for byte.
- Config keys or the resolver: run `bun scripts/capture-config-parity.ts` (zero diff), then `cargo test -p agent-file-tools --test integration config_parity`.
- Search ranking or routing files (the `RANKING_FENCE_PREFIXES` in `benchmarks/aft-search/search_quality_lib.py`): say so in your report. The train needs a search-quality descriptor, and ranking changes need benchmark evidence.

## TypeScript (`packages/*`)

Build the bridge first whenever you change it: `bun run --cwd packages/aft-bridge build`. The plugins import its `dist/`. A stale `dist/` gives "export not found" or "property does not exist" errors that look like your bug.

| Gate | Command | Proof it ran |
|---|---|---|
| Lint (Biome 2.x) | `bun run lint` at the repo root | `Checked N files`. Show `./node_modules/.bin/biome --version`. |
| Typecheck | `bun run --cwd packages/<pkg> typecheck` | Exit 0. Name the package. |
| Unit tests | `bun run --cwd packages/<pkg> test:unit` | `N pass` / `0 fail` with N > 0. |
| End-to-end tests | `bun run --cwd packages/opencode-plugin test:e2e` (and pi-plugin) | Same as above. They spawn `target/debug/aft`. |

New test files go under `src/__tests__/`. A guard fails the suite on any test file elsewhere.

## Do not
- **Pipe a gated command** (`cmd | tail`, `cmd | grep`). The pipe's exit code hides the failure. Run it bare, or save output to a file and read the file.
- **Run TypeScript end-to-end suites while cargo is building** the same checkout. Cargo rewrites `target/debug/aft` mid-run and every bridge test fails with "Bridge shutting down".
- **Run the plugin end-to-end or permission suites from a worktree under `/tmp`.** The temp-directory permission exemption makes their assertions wrong.
- **Generate synthetic CPU load** (busy loops, stress tools). To test timing under load, use the injected-delay test hooks (`test-timing-hooks`) or a narrower deadline.
- **Run `aft_inspect` on Rust files while your own build or tests are compiling.** Its rust-analyzer check can hold the target lock.
- **Write closing keywords** (`Fixes #N`, `Closes #N`, `Resolves #N`) in commit messages. Write `(#N)`.
- **Edit `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `STRUCTURE.md`** to log a change.

## Before you report
- Show a failing test before the fix. Show a mutation check for each fix: revert the fix, name the test that fails and paste the failure, restore, and show `git diff --stat` empty.
- If a gate could not run, say which one and why. Do not report it as passed.
