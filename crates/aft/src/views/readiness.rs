//! Per-plane readiness that does not depend on whether disk differs from the
//! generation.
//!
//! Pending and failed plane work is part of each published manifest entry, so
//! it survives folds, eviction and restart. A fold that publishes a file's
//! content before that file's semantic fill finishes keeps the entry
//! `Pending`; the pending count comes from the generation's entries **and**
//! from live entries, never from live entries alone, because the live entry
//! disappears as soon as disk equals the new generation.
