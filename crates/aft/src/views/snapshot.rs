//! Pinned query snapshots, the live delta, and the generation switch.
//!
//! A query reads one `(generation, delta version, intent version)` snapshot,
//! taken before its first index read, and never re-reads the pointer
//! mid-query. Taking a snapshot is an `Arc` clone: the generation is kept
//! resident by one read marker per open generation, not one per query.
//!
//! The live delta holds the difference between the checkout's disk and its
//! generation. Its invariant: **an entry exists for a path exactly when the
//! last observed disk state differs from the generation's entry**. Every
//! mutation is journaled, including one that removes an entry, because the
//! generation switch needs it.
//!
//! When a new generation `G+1` is published (by this daemon or by another
//! one), the successor delta is derived over
//! `K = keys(delta@v) ∪ paths(diff(G, G+1))`: for each path in `K` the last
//! observed disk state is the live entry's if there is one, else `G`'s entry
//! (exact, by the invariant), and the successor has an entry exactly when that
//! state differs from `G+1`. The rule never reads what the fold itself read,
//! so it is correct for a revert to `G`'s bytes or an add-then-delete anywhere
//! between the fold's read and the swap, and for a foreign CAS winner.
//! Mutations after `v` are replayed from the journal under the swap lock, and
//! a successor built against an older epoch is discarded.
