//! Bash command rewriter for hoisted bash.
//!
//! Rewriting is an optimization of native bash, not a second command
//! language. The dispatch layer makes a pre-execution decision and records it
//! for differential tests. Once a request is accepted, its handler response is
//! returned directly; native bash is never run as a recovery path.
