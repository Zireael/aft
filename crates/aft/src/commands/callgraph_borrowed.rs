//! Disclosure for callgraph answers served from another checkout's graph.
//!
//! A linked worktree, or a second clone of the same repository, does not build
//! its own callgraph store: it reads the one the owning checkout publishes
//! (borrow-only mode, see `artifact_owner`). That graph describes the owner's
//! files. When this checkout sits on another commit or has edits of its own,
//! callers, line numbers and even whether a symbol exists can differ from the
//! files here, and an unmarked answer would look complete and current.
//!
//! Until each checkout gets its own graph view, every callgraph query answered
//! from a borrowed store checks whether the borrowed graph can differ from this
//! checkout and, when it can, marks the answer `complete: false` with a
//! one-line explanation. The check uses only signals already at hand: the two
//! checkouts' HEAD commits, read straight from the git metadata files, and
//! the per-file content hashes the callgraph store recorded, compared with
//! the hashes the search index's RAM overlay holds for this checkout's files.
//! It never walks the working tree; when the two checkouts share a commit and
//! some files differ, git is asked which of them this checkout has edited.
//!
//! The graph cannot see what those differing files hold here, so an answer
//! that depends on them is extended or qualified: `callers` and `impact`
//! search the differing files for the target's name (a bounded read of only
//! those files) and list what they find as name-matched, and an answer that is
//! still empty names the files the graph does not reflect and suggests grep
//! rather than reading as "nothing calls this".
