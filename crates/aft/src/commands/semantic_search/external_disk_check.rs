//! Checking another project's saved search index against its files on disk.
//!
//! `aft_search` with a `path` in another project answers from that project's
//! saved AFT index when one exists. Nothing in this session refreshes that
//! index, and opening it only parses the saved file, so a file edited, added
//! or deleted since the index was saved would otherwise be answered from what
//! it held then, or not at all.
//!
//! Before such an index answers a query, [`check_against_disk`] walks the
//! project once, checking a deadline at every walk entry, and compares each
//! file's size and modification time with the index's record of it:
//!
//! - unchanged files keep the saved postings and are not read;
//! - changed and new files are read from disk into an in-memory copy of the
//!   index (the saved file is never written), source files first, under a
//!   second deadline;
//! - files the index lists but the finished walk did not find are dropped.
//!
//! The returned [`DiskCheck`] says how many files were examined and whether the
//! walk and the re-reading finished, so the reply can say whether its answer
//! reflects every file on disk or only part of the project.
