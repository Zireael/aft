//! Cross-encoder reranking of the head of the canonical result list.
//!
//! A reranker scores the prose `query` against a short text built for each of
//! the first entries of the canonical list and reorders only those entries.
//! Only queries the live router classifies as prose are reranked (see
//! [`is_prose_query`]); identifier, path, literal and regex queries keep the
//! fused order exactly as with reranking off.
//! Backends implement [`RerankBackend`]; everything that decides *what* is
//! reranked (how many entries, which tiers, the candidate text, the defaults
//! and clamps of the `search.rerank` config block) lives in this module so it
//! stays inside the search-quality ranking fence.
//!
//! Paging contract. The canonical list is rebuilt on every request, and a
//! backend may answer one request and not the next (model still downloading,
//! worker busy, a timeout). If page one were served in fused order and page two
//! in reranked order, the stream would repeat some results and lose others. So
//! the first outcome for a list identity (a permutation, or the decision to
//! skip) is committed to a process-wide memo and every later page of the same
//! list replays it. The identity covers everything that defines the reranked
//! prefix and nothing that selects a page: `topK` and `offset` never enter it.
