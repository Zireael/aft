//! Operating-system metadata files that project walks and the file watcher skip.

//! Finder, Explorer and friends drop small bookkeeping files into ordinary
//! folders: an "empty" macOS `~/Desktop` still holds a hidden `.localized`, so
//! the search index reported one file there. None of these files ever matter
//! for code search, so every project walk that feeds an index (trigram,
//! semantic, callgraph) or a glob/grep filesystem fallback leaves them out, and
//! the watcher drops their change events so a Finder `.DS_Store` rewrite never
//! triggers a refresh. An explicit read or edit of one of these paths is not
//! affected: only walks and watch events consult this list.
//!
//! Matching is on the exact file name, at any depth.
