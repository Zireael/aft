//! The per-root `aft.db` open that a route bind defers past its reply.
//!
//! A bind acknowledges before the root's database is open, so read-only tools
//! work at once while persistence-dependent tools (bash, edits, undo, state)
//! wait a bounded time for the open. The open used to run as a stage of the
//! root's configure tail, and configure tails are admitted a few at a time
//! across every root and share the executor's maintenance workers with index
//! work. After a daemon restart dozens of roots bind together, every tail
//! queues, and a root's database waited for other roots' view loads, storage
//! sweeps and callgraph warms: about two minutes in one captured restart,
//! while mutating tools were refused as "still initializing".
//!
//! The open now runs on a dedicated thread, dispatched right after the bind
//! acknowledgement is sent. It never enters the executor, so no index build,
//! tier-2 refresh or other root's maintenance can hold it back. The configure
//! tail still reaches its database stage, and there it runs the open itself if
//! nothing dispatched it (standalone mode, tests) or waits for the dedicated
//! thread to finish, so session replay always sees the selected database.
//!
//! Each finished open logs one line per root with the time from the bind's
//! configure commit to database-ready and where that time went.
