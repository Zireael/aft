//! Reading a scope file as source text for the Tier-2 tree-sitter scanners
//! (complexity, duplicates), and reporting the files that could not be read
//! that way.
//!
//! A single file whose bytes are not valid UTF-8 (a GBK- or Latin-1-encoded
//! data file, for example) used to abort the whole category build. Such a file
//! is now a per-file skip: it contributes nothing, its contribution records the
//! reason, and the category reports it as a named gap
//! (`complete: false`, `skipped_files: [{file, reason}]`). The skip is stored
//! as the file's cached contribution, so it is not re-read until the file
//! changes, and a changed file that is now valid UTF-8 is analyzed normally.
