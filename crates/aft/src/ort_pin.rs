//! Integrity pin for the ONNX Runtime library AFT loads at run time.
//!
//! AFT does not link ONNX Runtime: it loads the shared library by path
//! (`dlopen` / `LoadLibrary`) once semantic search or the reranker first needs
//! it. The usual path is the runtime AFT's installer downloaded into a
//! user-writable folder (`<storage>/onnxruntime/<version>/`).
//!
//! On macOS the supervised module binary is signed with hardened runtime and
//! the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement. Hardened
//! runtime is what keeps other processes of the same user from attaching a
//! debugger and reading the module's launch secret; the entitlement is needed
//! because Microsoft's library carries no Team ID and library validation would
//! refuse it. With library validation off, the loader no longer checks who
//! signed the file, so without this pin any same-user process could replace
//! the downloaded library and run its code inside AFT.
//!
//! The rule enforced here, on every platform, before any load:
//! - a library whose sha256 is on [`PINNED_ORT_LIBRARIES`] is accepted;
//! - otherwise the library is accepted only when `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` named it in
//!   the environment this process was spawned with, and the path is outside
//!   AFT's own managed runtime folder. That is the operator's explicit choice
//!   (a Homebrew or distro runtime), accepted unpinned and logged once. A value
//!   AFT exported itself after resolving its managed download never counts:
//!   the spawn-time value is captured before AFT sets anything;
//! - anything else is refused with `onnx runtime library hash mismatch at
//!   <path>` and is never handed to the loader.
//!
//! With no path at all the library would be found by bare name on the loader
//! search path, where there is no file to hash first. The supervised module
//! (`aft --subc`), the only mode that holds a launch secret, refuses that;
//! a standalone process keeps it, logged once as unpinned, so users relying on
//! a system-installed runtime keep working.
//!
//! # Hashing and loading the same file
//!
//! Hashing a path and then loading the same path leaves a window: a process
//! that can write the folder could replace the file after the hash matched and
//! before the loader opened it. A pinned library is therefore opened once,
//! hashed through that open file, and loaded through the same open file, so
//! the loader maps the file that was hashed whatever the path names by then:
//! - macOS: `dlopen("/dev/fd/<n>")`. Opening `/dev/fd/<n>` duplicates the
//!   descriptor, so dyld maps the inode that was hashed. Measured on macOS 27
//!   with the 1.24.4 library, from a plain binary and from one signed with
//!   hardened runtime and `disable-library-validation`: the load succeeds, a
//!   second `dlopen` of the same `/dev/fd` path returns the same handle, and
//!   renaming another library over the original path between `open` and
//!   `dlopen` still loads the hashed 1.24.4 file (the replacement's
//!   constructor never runs; loading the same swap by path runs it). dyld
//!   records the file's real path for the image (`dladdr` names it), so
//!   `@loader_path` still resolves as for a load by path.
//! - Linux: `dlopen("/proc/self/fd/<n>")`, which reopens the inode behind the
//!   descriptor.
//! - Windows: the file stays open with only read sharing (no write or delete
//!   sharing) until the load is over, so it cannot be rewritten, replaced,
//!   renamed or deleted, and `LoadLibrary` of its path loads the bytes that
//!   were hashed.
//!
//! Residual, macOS and Linux: the same user can still rewrite the hashed file
//! in place (same inode) between the hash and the moment the loader maps it;
//! no user-space lock stops a same-user writer. After loading, the file is
//! checked again (same device, inode, size, change time, and a fresh sha256
//! through the open file) and the load is reported as failed if anything
//! changed, so the library is never used. That detects the rewrite but cannot
//! undo it: the library's initializers have already run by then. The same
//! check also fails a load whose file was replaced by a rename meanwhile (the
//! unlinked original's change time moves), even though the checked bytes were
//! the ones loaded: a library replaced mid-load means something is writing to
//! the folder, and the load fails closed. Windows residual: a directory
//! junction on the path could be re-pointed during the load; AFT's own runtime
//! folder contains none.
//!
//! An operator's library (named by `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` at spawn, outside the
//! managed folder) is accepted whatever its bytes are, so there is no check to
//! race; it is loaded by its path, as before, which keeps any sibling
//! libraries it resolves relative to its own location loadable.
//!
//! No private copy of the library is made, so there is nothing left behind in
//! AFT's storage to clean up.
