//! Daemon-side relay for governed `gh` bot writes.
//!
//! The `gh` shim runs as an agent's child with no subc credentials, so it
//! cannot mint an agent assertion or reach plexus itself: both require the
//! attested `reserved:aft` principal that only this daemon holds. The shim
//! instead sends its per-command ticket (see [`crate::gh_shim_ticket`]) and the
//! unchanged governed request envelope to one of the management operations
//! below. The daemon redeems the ticket to the session that spawned the
//! command, mints an assertion for that session from prefrontal, calls plexus
//! with it, and hands plexus's reply back unchanged.
//!
//! The ticket is the only authority. A session or agent field in the body is
//! never used to pick the speaker, and a missing or unknown ticket is refused
//! before anything leaves the daemon.
//!
//! A bot write goes out on one of two paths:
//!
//! - **stamp**: the session's tool route was bound under a daemon scope that
//!   lets providers act as the session's agent (see [`delegating_agent`]). The
//!   daemon then opens its plexus route under that same scope and sends the
//!   write without an assertion; plexus reads the agent from the scope stamp on
//!   that route and re-checks the scope before each write it sends.
//! - **assertion**: everything else. The daemon mints a signed assertion from
//!   prefrontal and sends it with the write on an unscoped route.
//!
//! The stamp path needs a transport that can open a scoped route
//! ([`RelayTransport::opens_scoped_routes`]). The production transport can:
//! it opens the route with the subc client's scoped open, and never falls back
//! to an unscoped route when that open is refused.
