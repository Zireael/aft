        "Usage: aft cache prune-legacy [--yes]

Lists every legacy (pre-view) index set under the AFT storage root with its
bytes, and with --yes deletes the sets whose import into per-checkout views
completed at least {days} days ago. Without --yes it is a dry run.

{OPERATOR_CONTRACT}

A run refuses when another aft or ck-aft process is running, when a process
that looks like AFT cannot be classified, or when the process list cannot be
read. With --yes, each eligible set is first renamed as a whole into
<storage>/.prune-legacy-<timestamp>/ on the same filesystem, the check runs
again, and only then is that directory deleted. A set that cannot be renamed
atomically is skipped, never deleted in place.

The storage root is AFT_STORAGE_DIR when set, otherwise the default.

Exit codes: 0 done or dry run, 2 usage error, 3 refused by the process
check, 4 a process appeared after sets were moved aside (they are kept and a
later run removes them), 5 a set was skipped.
